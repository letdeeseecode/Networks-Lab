Assignment 2: Write a program using TCP socket to implement the following:
i. Server maintains records of fruits in the format: fruit-name, quantity Last-sold,
(server timestamp),
ii. Multiple client purchase the fruits one at a time,
iii. The fruit quantity is updated each time any fruit is sold,
iv. Send regret message to a client if therequested quantityof the fruit is not
available.
v. Display the customer ids <IP, port> who has done transactions already. This
list should be updated in the server every time a transaction occurs.
vi. The total number of unique customers who did some transaction will be
displayed to the customer every time.
